            <p>
              I am an NYC based pianist and educator with years of experience
              teaching a wide range of ages and experience levels. Iâ€™m excited
              to help guide you through your musical journey, wherever you may
              be in it. I believe every student is capable of not only achieving
              their goals at the piano and but of developing a deeper
              appreciation for music while doing it. Through my passion and
              enthusiasm for music, my goal for every student is to get them as
              excited about making music as I am.
