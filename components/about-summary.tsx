        I am an NYC based pianist and educator with years of experience teaching
        a wide range of ages and experience levels. Iâ€™m excited to help guide
        you through your musical journey, wherever you may be in it. I believe
        every student is capable of not only achieving their goals at the piano
        and but of developing a deeper appreciation for music while doing it.
        Through my passion and enthusiasm for music, my goal for every student
        is to get them as excited about making music as I am.
